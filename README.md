# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
=====================================================

## Introduction
------------

This project is designed to create a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques in Python. It leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to analyze movie metadata and provide personalized movie suggestions.

## Project Overview
-----------------

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately recommend movies based on their content attributes. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset from TMDB, this project enables users to discover new movies that align with their interests.

## Key Features
--------------

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The project involves collecting a dataset containing movie metadata, such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew. Using Pandas and NumPy, the collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: The project employs content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies based on their attributes, such as genres and keywords.
- **Data Visualization**: The project uses Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Deployment**: The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used
--------------------

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive user interface.

## Dataset
----------

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the TMDB dataset, which includes:

- **Movie Metadata**: Information about each movie, such as title, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**: Available on Kaggle.
